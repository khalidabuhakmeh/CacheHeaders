# HTTP ETag Caching

Using the CacheCow NuGet package to do ETags on an ASP.NET Core MVC endpoint.

This allows clients to use cache copies of responses, reducing the network traffic between a client and server, making for better user experiences.

Included a [test.http](./CacheHeaders/test.http) than you can
run using [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider).
